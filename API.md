# BabyTracker API Documentation

Base URL: `https://<host>/api` (production — default port 443)

> The Home Assistant add-on runs on port 8099 internally, behind HA's
> ingress proxy. External clients should use the HA-provided URL, not
> the internal port.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. Two methods are supported:

### JWT Bearer Token (for browser/frontend)

```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "admin", "password": "yourpassword"}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

Use in requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The access token lasts an hour. Renew it with:

```
POST /api/auth/refresh
```

which reads the long-lived (30-day) refresh token from the `refresh_token`
cookie set at login, rotates it, and returns a fresh access token.

`POST /api/auth/logout` revokes the session server-side.

#### Sessions under Home Assistant ingress

Inside the ingress iframe the browser frequently drops the refresh cookie. When
BabyTracker detects it is running as an add-on, the login/refresh response
additionally carries the refresh token in the body:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "..."
}
```

and `/api/auth/refresh` and `/api/auth/logout` accept it back the same way:

```
POST /api/auth/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{"refresh_token": "..."}
```

The body token takes precedence over the cookie there, because a cookie the
browser kept after missing a `Set-Cookie` points at a rotation that has already
happened. **Outside the add-on this field is absent and a body token is
ignored** — the cookie works there and is `HttpOnly`, which is worth keeping.

#### Rate limits

`/api/auth/login` allows 10 attempts per minute **per account**, and
`/api/auth/refresh` 30 per minute **per user**. They are deliberately not keyed
by IP: under ingress every request arrives from the Supervisor's proxy, so an
IP-keyed limit is a single allowance shared by the entire household. Coarser
per-address ceilings still apply as flood guards.

Exceeding a limit returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header. A `429` is a
transient condition — **only `401` means the session is gone.**

### API Token (for integrations)

Create a token in Settings > Integrations > API Tokens, or via the API:

```
POST /api/tokens/
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"name": "Home Assistant", "permissions": "read_write"}
```

Response includes a `token` field — save it, it's only shown once.

Use in requests:
```
Authorization: Token <token>
```

Permissions: `read` (GET only) or `read_write` (all methods).

## Display Control (Picture Frame / Slideshow)

Control the picture frame slideshow mode on connected browser clients. Designed for Home Assistant and similar automation tools.

### How it works

1. Each browser connects to an SSE (Server-Sent Events) stream
2. Browsers register with a **device name** (set in Settings > General > Device Name)
3. The API can target all devices or a specific device by name
4. Commands are pushed in real time — no polling, no page refresh

### List connected devices

```
GET /api/display
Authorization: Token <token>
```

Response:
```json
{
  "connected_devices": ["nursery-tablet", "kitchen-screen"]
}
```

### Start slideshow

Target all devices:
```
PUT /api/display
Authorization: Token <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"picture_frame": true}
```

Target a specific device:
```
PUT /api/display
Authorization: Token <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"picture_frame": true, "device": "nursery-tablet"}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "picture_frame": true,
  "device": "nursery-tablet",
  "devices_targeted": 1
}
```

### Stop slideshow

```
PUT /api/display
Authorization: Token <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"picture_frame": false, "device": "nursery-tablet"}
```

### URL-based slideshow (for Fully Kiosk Browser)

Navigate to this URL to start the slideshow immediately:
```
https://<host>/?slideshow=true
```

Tapping the screen exits the slideshow and removes the query parameter.

### SSE stream (for custom integrations)

```
GET /api/display/events?device=<device_name>
```

This is a Server-Sent Events stream. Each message is a JSON object:
```
data: {"picture_frame": true, "device": "nursery-tablet"}
```

### Home Assistant configuration

```yaml
# rest_command in configuration.yaml
rest_command:
  babytracker_slideshow_start:
    url: "https://babytracker.local/api/display"
    method: PUT
    headers:
      Authorization: "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: '{"picture_frame": true, "device": "{{ device }}"}'

  babytracker_slideshow_stop:
    url: "https://babytracker.local/api/display"
    method: PUT
    headers:
      Authorization: "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: '{"picture_frame": false, "device": "{{ device }}"}'
```

Example automations:
```yaml
# Start slideshow when nursery lights turn off
automation:
  - alias: "Nursery slideshow on"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: light.nursery
        to: "off"
    action:
      - service: rest_command.babytracker_slideshow_start
        data:
          device: nursery-tablet

  # Stop slideshow on motion
  - alias: "Nursery slideshow off"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.nursery_motion
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: rest_command.babytracker_slideshow_stop
        data:
          device: nursery-tablet
```

## Data Endpoints

All data endpoints follow the same pattern and return paginated responses:

```json
{
  "count": 42,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [...]
}
```

### Common query parameters

| `limit` | Results per page (max 1000) | `?limit=50` |
| `offset` | Skip N results | `?offset=50` |
| `ordering` | Sort field (prefix `-` for DESC) | `?ordering=-start` |
| `start_min` | Filter entries after this time | `?start_min=2026-01-01T00:00:00` |
| `start_max` | Filter entries before this time | `?start_max=2026-12-31T23:59:59` |
| `date_min` | Filter by date (for date-based entities) | `?date_min=2026-01-01` |

PATCH  /api/bmi/{id}/          Update
DELETE /api/bmi/{id}/          Delete
```

Body: `{child, date, bmi, notes}`

### Pumping

```
GET    /api/pumping/           List
POST   /api/pumping/           Create
PATCH  /api/pumping/{id}/      Update
DELETE /api/pumping/{id}/      Delete
```

Body: `{child, start, end, amount}`

### Uneaten milk

Expressed milk that was prepared but poured away. It is not a feeding — it never
counts as intake — but it does leave the stash, so the milk-stock balance
subtracts it. `amount` is required and must be greater than zero.

```
GET    /api/milk-waste/        List
POST   /api/milk-waste/        Create
PATCH  /api/milk-waste/{id}/   Update
DELETE /api/milk-waste/{id}/   Delete
```

Body: `{child, time, amount, notes}`

Gated by the `pumping` RBAC feature rather than one of its own, so no extra role
permissions are needed. Unlike the other entry types it carries no photo and
cannot be tagged.

### Milk stock

```
GET /api/milk-stock?child=1
```

Returns the running stash balance over all time — a stash is cumulative, so a
per-period figure would be meaningless:

```json
{"pumped": 200, "bottle_fed": 70, "discarded": 30, "stock": 100}
```

`bottle_fed` counts only bottle feeds of `breast milk` or `fortified breast
milk`: nursing at the breast never touches the stash, and formula never came
from it. The balance is an estimate — it only reconciles if every pumping
session and every bottle is logged with an amount. A negative `stock` is
returned as-is rather than clamped, because it means something isn't being
logged.

### Medications

```
GET    /api/medications/       List
POST   /api/medications/       Create
PATCH  /api/medications/{id}/  Update
DELETE /api/medications/{id}/  Delete
```

Body: `{child, time, name, dosage, dosage_unit, notes}`

### Milestones

```
GET    /api/milestones/        List
POST   /api/milestones/        Create
PATCH  /api/milestones/{id}/   Update
DELETE /api/milestones/{id}/   Delete
```

Body: `{child, date, title, category, description}`
Categories: `motor`, `cognitive`, `social`, `language`, `other`

### Notes

```
GET    /api/notes/             List
POST   /api/notes/             Create
PATCH  /api/notes/{id}/        Update
DELETE /api/notes/{id}/        Delete
```

Body: `{child, time, note}`

### Timers

```
GET    /api/timers/            List all active timers
POST   /api/timers/            Create
PATCH  /api/timers/{id}/       Update (e.g., change start time)
DELETE /api/timers/{id}/       Delete (discard timer)
```

Body (create): `{child, name}` — `name` is e.g. "Feeding", "Sleep", "Tummy Time"

## Photos

### Standalone photos (bulk upload)

```
POST /api/photos/
Authorization: Token <token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

child=1
photos=@photo1.jpg
photos=@photo2.jpg
```

Date is extracted from EXIF metadata automatically. Falls back to today if no EXIF data.

```
GET    /api/photos/            List standalone photos
PATCH  /api/photos/{id}/       Update caption/date
DELETE /api/photos/{id}/       Delete photo and file
```

### Entry photos

Attach a photo to any entry:
```
POST /api/{entity_type}/{id}/photo
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

photo=@image.jpg
```

Entity types: `feedings`, `sleep`, `changes`, `tummy-times`, `temperature`, `weight`, `height`, `head-circumference`, `pumping`, `medications`, `milestones`, `notes`, `bmi`, `children`

Remove a photo from an entry:
```
DELETE /api/{entity_type}/{id}/photo
```

### Photo gallery

Returns all photos (standalone + entry photos) for a child:
```
GET /api/gallery/?child=1
```

### Serving photos

```
GET /api/media/photos/{filename}
GET /api/media/photos/{filename}?size=thumb
GET /api/media/photos/{filename}?size=medium
```

Requires authentication via refresh token cookie or Authorization header.

The optional `?size=` parameter returns a cached resized JPEG:
- `thumb` — longest edge 300 px (used by the gallery grid)
- `medium` — longest edge 800 px
- omitted — original file, untouched

Thumbnails are generated on first request, cached on disk, and respect EXIF orientation. Served with a 24-hour `Cache-Control` header.

---

## Data Export

```
GET /api/export/csv?child=1&type=all
```

Types: `all`, `feedings`, `sleep`, `changes`, `tummy_times`, `weight`, `height`, `head_circumference`, `temperature`, `pumping`, `milk_waste`, `medications`, `milestones`

Returns a CSV file download.

---

## User Management (admin only)

### Users

```
GET    /api/users/             List all users with their access
POST   /api/users/             Create user: {username, password, is_admin}
DELETE /api/users/{id}/        Delete user

DELETE /api/roles/{id}/                Delete custom role
```

Predefined roles: `parent` (full write), `caregiver` (write daily, read measurements), `viewer` (read only)

Permission levels: `none`, `read`, `write`

Features: `feeding`, `sleep`, `diaper`, `tummy`, `temp`, `weight`, `height`, `headcirc`, `pumping`, `bmi`, `medication`, `milestone`, `note`, `photo`

---

## Webhooks

```
GET    /api/webhooks/          List webhooks
POST   /api/webhooks/          Create: {name, url, secret, events, active}
PATCH  /api/webhooks/{id}/     Update
DELETE /api/webhooks/{id}/     Delete
```

`events` is `*` (all) or a comma-separated list of exact event names (see below). `secret` must be ≥16 chars — it's the HMAC-SHA256 key used to sign every delivery.

### Event delivery

When activity occurs, BabyTracker POSTs JSON to every active webhook whose `events` filter matches. The body is:

```json
{
  "event": "feeding.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-15T14:23:15.123Z",
  "data": { /* the row that was just written, same shape as the create-endpoint response */ }
}
```

Request headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Webhook-Event` | event name (duplicated for routing-table convenience) |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | `sha256=<hex(hmac_sha256(secret, raw_body))>` — GitHub-style |
| `User-Agent` | `BabyTracker-Webhook/1` |

Subscribers **must** verify the signature before trusting the payload. Pseudocode:

```python
import hmac, hashlib
expected = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
if not hmac.compare_digest(request.headers["X-Webhook-Signature"], expected):
    return 401
```

### Delivery semantics

- Fire-and-forget from the HTTP handler — delivery is asynchronous on a bounded in-process queue.
- 5 second per-request timeout.
- Retries: 3 attempts total on failure, backing off 1s / 5s / 25s.
- After all retries exhaust, the row's `last_status_code` is updated with the last non-2xx code (or `0` on connection failure) and the event is dropped.
- If the queue fills up (unusual — 256-slot buffer), events are dropped with a warning log rather than blocking the HTTP handler. The HA integration's polling fallback catches any missed events.

### Event names (v1)

Activity events fire on `POST` (or `DELETE` for timers):

| Event | Fired when |
|---|---|
| `feeding.created` | `POST /api/feedings/` succeeds |
| `sleep.created` | `POST /api/sleep/` |
| `diaper.created` | `POST /api/changes/` |
| `tummy_time.created` | `POST /api/tummy-times/` |
| `pumping.created` | `POST /api/pumping/` |
| `milk_waste.created` | `POST /api/milk-waste/` |
| `temperature.created` | `POST /api/temperature/` |
| `medication.created` | `POST /api/medications/` |
| `note.created` | `POST /api/notes/` |
| `milestone.created` | `POST /api/milestones/` |
| `weight.created` | `POST /api/weight/` |
| `height.created` | `POST /api/height/` |
| `head_circumference.created` | `POST /api/head-circumference/` |
| `bmi.created` | `POST /api/bmi/` |
| `timer.started` | `POST /api/timers/` |
| `timer.stopped` | `DELETE /api/timers/{id}/` |

`*.updated` / `*.deleted` events are not emitted in v1 — use polling (or the explicit API) to reconcile state changes.

## API Tokens

```
GET    /api/tokens/            List tokens (token value is hidden)
POST   /api/tokens/            Create: {name, permissions, expires_at?} — returns token once
DELETE /api/tokens/{id}/       Revoke token
```

`expires_at` is an optional RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g. `"2026-12-31T00:00:00Z"`). Omit it for a non-expiring token. Past timestamps are rejected with `400`. Expired tokens return `401` on use and are filtered from DB lookups.

---

## Tags

```
GET    /api/tags/                          List all tags
POST   /api/tags/                          Create: {name, color}
PATCH  /api/tags/{id}/                     Update
DELETE /api/tags/{id}/                     Delete
GET    /api/tags/{entityType}/{entityId}/  Get tags for an entry
PUT    /api/tags/{entityType}/{entityId}/  Set tags: {tag_ids: [1, 2]}
```

---

## Configuration

```
GET /api/config
```

Public endpoint (no auth required). Returns:
```json
{
  "refresh_interval": 30,
  "demo_mode": false,
  "unit_system": "metric",
  "setup_mode": false,
  "appliance_mode": false
}
```

- `setup_mode`: true during first-boot Wi-Fi setup (Pi image only)
- `appliance_mode`: true when running as a Pi appliance (TLS configured)

---

## Backups (admin only)

Backups are `.tar.gz` files containing a PostgreSQL dump and all photos. Encrypted backups have an additional `.enc` suffix and are AES-256-GCM streams keyed by an Argon2id-derived key from the per-destination passphrase.

### Listing backups

```
GET /api/backups/
```

Returns one entry per unique filename, with the destinations holding a copy:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "backup_20260415_030000.tar.gz",
      "size": 4823901,
      "date": "2026-04-15 03:00:01",
      "encrypted": false,
      "destinations": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Local",     "type": "local"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Nextcloud", "type": "webdav"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating a backup

```
POST /api/backups/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "destination_ids": [1, 2],
  "passphrases": {"2": "the-passphrase"}
}
```

Both fields are optional. Empty `destination_ids` targets every enabled destination. `passphrases` is keyed by destination ID and only required for encrypted destinations whose passphrase isn't stored on the server.

The response reports per-destination success/failure:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {"destination_id": 1, "destination": "Local",     "filename": "backup_20260415_103015.tar.gz"},
    {"destination_id": 2, "destination": "Nextcloud", "filename": "backup_20260415_103015.tar.gz.enc"}
  ]
}
```

### Download / delete

```
GET    /api/backups/download?name=<file>&destination_id=<id>
DELETE /api/backups/?name=<file>&destination_id=<id>
```

`destination_id` is required: a backup file may exist at multiple destinations and each is independent.

### Restore

```
POST /api/backups/restore
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Two modes:

| Field | Mode |
|-------|------|
| `backup=<file>` | Upload a `.tar.gz` (or `.tar.gz.enc`) directly. |
| `destination_id=<id>` + `name=<file>` | Pull from a configured destination. |

Optional fields (both modes):

- `passphrase=<string>` — required for encrypted backups.
- `wipe_photos=true` — also delete photo files in `DATA_DIR/photos` that aren't in the backup. Default is `false` (safe for shared `MEDIA_PATH` setups, e.g. Home Assistant media).

Restore wipes and recreates the `public` schema before applying the dump (single transaction, `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`).

### First-boot restore (no auth)

```
POST /api/auth/setup-restore
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

backup=<file>
[passphrase=<string>]
```

Available only when no user accounts exist (returns 403 once any user is created). Used by the first-boot screen so a backup can be restored before signing in. Rate-limited to 3 requests/minute.

### Backup destinations (admin only)

```
GET    /api/backups/destinations             List destinations
POST   /api/backups/destinations             Create
PATCH  /api/backups/destinations/{id}        Update
DELETE /api/backups/destinations/{id}        Delete (does not touch remote files)
POST   /api/backups/destinations/{id}/test   Connectivity test
POST   /api/backups/destinations/inspect-cert  Fetch a server's TLS cert (pre-create)
```

A destination row:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Nextcloud",
  "type": "webdav",
  "config": {
    "url": "https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/files/me/",
    "username": "me",
    "directory": "BabyTracker/backups",
    "password_set": true,
    "tls": {
      "mode": "pin",
      "subject": "CN=cloud.example.com",
      "fingerprint": "A3:B1:F2:...:89",
      "not_after": "2027-04-15T00:00:00Z"
    },
    "encryption": {"enabled": true, "passphrase_saved": true}
  },
  "retention_count": 30,
  "auto_backup": true,
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule": "0 3 * * *",
  "created_at": "2026-04-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Passwords, stored passphrases, S3 access/secret keys, and raw pinned-certificate PEMs are never returned in `GET` responses — only the boolean `password_set` / `passphrase_saved` / `s3_access_key_id_set` / `s3_secret_access_key_set` flags and the certificate metadata needed to display the pinned cert (fingerprint, subject, expiry).

Secret fields are **encrypted at rest** in the database using a key derived from the server's JWT secret (see `internal/crypto/secrets.go`). A leaked DB dump alone is not enough to recover these credentials — the `.jwt_secret` file on the host is also required.

`POST` / `PATCH` request body shape:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `name` | string | Required on create. |
| `type` | string | `local`, `webdav`, or `s3`. Immutable after create. |
| `config` | object | Type-specific. Local: `{path}`. WebDAV: `{url, username, password, directory}`. S3: `{s3_bucket, s3_region, s3_prefix, s3_access_key_id, s3_secret_access_key, s3_endpoint_url, s3_use_path_style}`. Secret fields (`password`, `s3_access_key_id`, `s3_secret_access_key`) may be omitted on PATCH to keep the existing values. |
| `retention_count` | int | ≥ 1. Older backups at this destination are pruned after each upload. |
| `auto_backup` | bool | Whether the scheduler should fire this destination. |
| `enabled` | bool | Disabled destinations are listed but never used. |
| `schedule` | string | Cron expression (5 fields, server-local timezone). Empty string disables scheduling. |
| `enable_encryption` | bool | Set with `passphrase` to turn on encryption. |
| `passphrase` | string | New encryption passphrase. Stored as a verifier (Argon2id salt + AES-GCM-encrypted token); the raw value is only persisted when `save_passphrase=true`. |
| `save_passphrase` | bool | Required for scheduled backups against an encrypted destination. |
| `disable_encryption` | bool | PATCH-only. Removes encryption config from the destination. |
| `config.tls_mode` | string | WebDAV only. `strict` (default), `pin`, or `skip`. |
| `config.pinned_cert_pem` | string | Required when `tls_mode=pin` on create (or when rotating the pinned cert on PATCH). The PEM obtained from `inspect-cert`. |

Plain-HTTP WebDAV URLs are rejected unless `tls_mode=skip` is also set.

`POST /api/backups/destinations/{id}/test` returns `{"ok": true}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` (HTTP 200 either way).

### Inspect a server's TLS certificate (admin only)

Used by the UI when adding a WebDAV destination with a self-signed certificate. Opens a raw TLS handshake to the given URL (chain validation disabled — the whole point is to surface a cert the system doesn't yet trust) and returns its metadata so the user can verify the fingerprint against their server's admin panel before pinning it.

```
POST /api/backups/destinations/inspect-cert
Content-Type: application/json

{"url": "https://nas.home.lan/remote.php/dav/files/me/"}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "subject": "CN=nas.home.lan",
  "issuer": "CN=nas.home.lan",
  "not_before": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z",
  "not_after": "2027-04-10T00:00:00Z",
  "sha256_fingerprint": "A3:B1:F2:...:89",
  "self_signed": true,
  "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n..."
}
```

To pin the returned cert, send its `pem` back as `config.pinned_cert_pem` in a subsequent create or update request with `config.tls_mode=pin`.

## Baby Buddy Import (admin only)

Import data from an existing Baby Buddy instance:

```
POST /api/import/babybuddy
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://babybuddy.example.com",
  "token": "baby-buddy-api-key"
}
```

Fetches all children, feedings, sleep, changes, tummy times, temperature, weight, height, pumping, and notes via the Baby Buddy API. Handles pagination automatically.

---

## Password Management

Change your own password:
```
PUT /api/users/me/password
Content-Type: application/json

{"current_password": "old", "new_password": "new"}
```

Reset another user's password (admin only):
```
PUT /api/users/{id}/password
Content-Type: application/json

{"new_password": "new"}
```

---

## Photo Gallery

Aggregated view of all photos (standalone + entry-attached) for a child:

```
GET /api/gallery/?child=1
```

Tag a photo with a child:
```
POST /api/gallery/tag
Content-Type: application/json

{"filename": "photo-abc123.jpg", "child_id": 1}
```

---

## Domain Settings (admin only, appliance mode)

Get current custom domain:
```
GET /api/settings/domain
```

Response: `{"domain": "baby.example.com"}`

Set custom domain (enables Let's Encrypt):
```
PUT /api/settings/domain
Content-Type: application/json

{"domain": "baby.example.com"}
```

Requires DNS A record pointing to the device and port 443 forwarded. Restart required after changing.

---

## System Controls (admin only, appliance mode)

Restart the device:
```
POST /api/system/restart
```

Shut down the device:
```
POST /api/system/shutdown
```

These only work when running as a Pi appliance (appliance mode). The response is sent before the action executes.

---

## Setup (Pi first boot only)

These endpoints are only available when the device is in setup mode (first boot). They require no authentication.

```
GET  /api/setup/status          Setup status (see below)
POST /api/setup/ethernet        Finalize setup using Ethernet
POST /api/setup/wifi/connect    Connect to Wi-Fi and finalize setup
GET  /api/setup/wifi/scan       Scan for Wi-Fi networks (legacy — see note)
POST /api/setup/complete        Mark setup as complete (no network change)
```

### GET /api/setup/status

Returns which network interfaces the device has and their state, so the
wizard can decide what options to show.

```json
{
  "setup_mode": true,
  "connected": true,
  "has_ethernet": true,
  "ethernet_up": true,
  "ethernet_ip": "192.168.1.50",
  "has_wifi": true,
  "wifi_connected": false
}
```

### POST /api/setup/ethernet

Finalize setup using the wired connection. DHCP is the default; pass
`address`, `gateway`, and optionally `dns` for a static IP.

```json
{ "mode": "dhcp" }
```
```json
{
  "mode": "static",
  "address": "192.168.1.50/24",
  "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
  "dns": "1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Ethernet configured. BabyTracker is now available on your network.",
  "ip": "192.168.1.50",
  "hostname": "babytracker.local"
}
```

### POST /api/setup/wifi/connect

Connect to Wi-Fi. Optional `address`/`gateway`/`dns` apply a static IP
to the Wi-Fi connection. Response mirrors `/api/setup/ethernet`.

```json
{
  "ssid": "HomeNetwork",
  "password": "•••",
  "address": "192.168.1.50/24",
  "gateway": "192.168.1.1"
}
```

### GET /api/setup/wifi/scan (legacy)

The current setup wizard asks the user to type the SSID instead of scanning
(Pi WiFi chips can't scan while hostapd is holding the interface, and the
minimal image doesn't ship `iw`). The endpoint still returns the NetworkManager
scan cache for compatibility:

```json
[
  {"ssid": "HomeNetwork", "signal": "85", "security": "WPA2"},
  {"ssid": "Neighbor", "signal": "42", "security": "WPA2"}
]
```
